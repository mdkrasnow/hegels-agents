## Hypothesis Validation

**Core Hypothesis:** Dialectical debate between multiple AI agents improves reasoning quality.

**Validation Criteria:**
1. Mean improvement > 5%: ✓
2. >60% of tests show improvement: ✗

**Result:** Reconsider dialectical approach

## Recommendations


The dialectical approach does not show consistent improvement:

1. **Reassess Approach:** The current dialectical method may need refinement
2. **Investigate Issues:** Analyze why debates did not improve reasoning quality
3. **Alternative Strategies:** Consider different debate protocols or agent configurations
4. **Possible Issues:** Agent prompt design, synthesis algorithms, or question selection

The core hypothesis is not validated - further research needed before Phase 1.
